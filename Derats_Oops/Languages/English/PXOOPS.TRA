@1 = ~Hello my <LADYLORD>. Looking for new abilities? You've come to the right person.~
@2 = ~New abilities? How does it work?~
@3 = ~Ho, it's very simple: bring me a spell scroll and I'll draw energy from it to give you the special ability to cast the corresponding spell once a day. It's not free of course: it will cost you 10,000 gold coins and 1,000 experience points per level of the desired spell. So, is there a spell you'd like to cast?~
@4 = ~Hello, I'd like you to transform a scroll into special ability.~
@5 = ~Okay, what spell are you thinking of?~
@6 = ~And that's it. Anything else?~
@7 = ~No thanks, I don't need your services anymore.~
@8 = ~Yes, I'd like you to transform a scroll into a
special ability.~

@48 = ~It's okay, do it.~
@49 = ~No thanks, it's too expensive.~
@50 = ~I've got a complete grimoire: the Teachings of The Lady. Can you do something with it?~
@51 = ~Ho... a grimoire containing spells normally of divine order? This is an unusual spell book. I can try to convert everything in it into special abilities, but it's going to take a lot of energy. So I'm going to ask you for a special payment: I'll give you a wholesale price of 400,000 gold coins and I'll also ask you for the Robe of Vecna. It's a smaller investment than it would normally cost you.~ 
@52 = ~Ha, and it would also cost you 138,000 xp. There are around 140 levels of spells in this grimoire. It's up to you to decide whether you're prepared to pay this price.~
@53 = ~I don't own this robe. I'll be back.~
@54 = ~The character has lost 138000 xp.~
@55 = ~I wouldn't sacrifice this robe for that. No thanks.~

@60 = ~I've got a complete grimoire: the Rhialto's Spellbook. Can you do anything with it?~
@61 = ~Hum... a grimoire dedicated to Entropy. And with a special ability as well? Are you sure you want to part with this? Well, it's up to you... I can try to convert everything in it into special abilities, but it's going to take a lot of energy. So I'm going to ask you for a special payment: I'll give you a wholesale price of 400,000 gold coins and I'll also ask you for the Ring of Gaxx. It's a smaller investment than it would normally cost you.~
@62 = ~I forgot to mention that it would also cost you 146,000 xp. There are 146 cumulative spell levels in this grimoire. So, are you willing to pay this price?~
@63 = ~I don't own this ring. I'll be back.~
@64 = ~The character has lost 146000 xp.~
@65 = ~I wouldn't part with this ring for that. No thanks.~

@70 = ~I've got a complete grimoire: the Dillpater's Grimoire. Can you do anything with it?~
@71 = ~Where did you find this? I'm familiar with this type of work: it's normally found in the hands of incantifiers. And I doubt you've come across one, let alone got it from him. So, how did you get hold of it? That's your business. Yes, I can convert its contents into special abilities, but it's going to take a lot of energy. So I'm going to ask you for a special payment: I'll give you a wholesale price of 500,000 gold coins, plus the Deck of Many Things and a Staff of the Magi. It's a smaller investment than it would normally cost you.~
@72 = ~And of course, it would also cost you a not inconsiderable amount of xp: 173,000 xps to be precise. So, are you prepared to pay this price? ~
@73 = ~I don't own these items. I'll come back ~

@80 = ~ I've got a complete grimoire: Yratnuthul's Grimoire of Flames. Can you do anything with it?~
@81 = ~Hou... ! What kind of book is this? Spells below normal level? The mage who compiled this must have been pretty experienced to pull off such a feat! So yes, I can convert its contents into special abilities, but that's going to take a lot of energy. So in this case I'm going to ask you for a special payment: I'll give you a wholesale price of 300,000 gold coins and I'll also ask you for the marvellous Discombulator. It's a smaller investment than it would normally cost you.~
@82 = ~And it would also cost you 88,000 xps, don't forget. So, are you prepared to pay that price?~
