Oops is a magician you can meet near the Watchtower, in the south-west. He is there to be accessed in both SOA and TOB.

Oops can give you arcane spells to cast as special abilities. To do this, you need to present yourself to Oops with :
- The scroll of the spell you want to gain as a special ability.
- At least 10,000 gold coins
- At least 10,000 xp.
It won't offer you anything if you don't have this, and you can request an ability for each scroll you have in your possession (335+ possibilities) if you have enough gold and xp.

Earning an ability will cost you the corresponding scroll, 10,000 gold coins per spell level and 1,000 xp per spell level.

It can be repeated as often as you like, as long as you have what you need.
The casting times for special abilities are the same as for emulated spells.
Some spells are offered twice, because there are 2 versions of the scroll (found or bought, different price).

The mod also manages:
- IWDEE spells added by IWDification or SCS.
- Spells from my Interplan mod.
- the "Spacewarp" spell from the Test your mettle mod.
- the new arcane spells installed by SCS 35+.
- The "Teachings of The Lady" grimoire from the Semi Multi Cleric mod. If you want this grimoire to become 23 divine special abilities,
talk to Oops with this grimoire, 400000 pos, 138000 xp and the Robe of Vecna.
(Why such an important item? Because the original mod makes you lose 2 strength and 2 constitution, which the conversion by Oops doesn't do)
- the grimoire "Rhialto's Spellbook" from the Wild Mage Addition mod. If you want this grimoire to become 29 entropic special abilities,
talk to Oops with this grimoire, 400000 pos, 146000 xp and the Ring of Gaxx.
- The grimoire "Yratnuthul's Grimoire of flames" from the Interplan mod. If you want this grimoire to become 20 burning special abilities,
talk to Oops with this grimoire, 300000 pos, 88000 xp and the Wonderful Discombullator.
	
For all these spells/grimoires from mods to be taken into account, you need to install Oops AFTER these mods.
